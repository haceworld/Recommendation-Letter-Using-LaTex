% The material below is a whole big dang thing whose purpose is just to set up a fixed coordinate system for \tikz so that you can put the Department or School address in the upper right-hand side without it moving all around every time you change something in the page.  I think it works.
% Defining a new coordinate system for the page:
%
% --------------------------
% |(-1,1)    (0,1)    (1,1)|
% |                        |
% |(-1,0)    (0,0)    (1,0)|
% |                        |
% |(-1,-1)   (0,-1)  (1,-1)|
% --------------------------

\def\parsecomma#1,#2\endparsecomma{\def\page@x{#1}\def\page@y{#2}}

	\parsecomma#1\endparsecomma
	\pgfpointanchor{current page}{north east}
	% Save the upper right corner
	\pgf@xc=\pgf@x%
	\pgf@yc=\pgf@y%
	% save the lower left corner
